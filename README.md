## Features

- No resizable crop, so you won't have to know how big your portrait needs to be
- No "bad" surprises (stretching etc): the crop box are already at the required height and width, so there is no way to make a mistake (and find your neat small picture stretched like a macaroni) 
- inherit the previously cropped picture so you won't have to remember what the hell you cropped before (so if you cropped the nothingness during medium or full, nothingness you will crop in small)
- random uid generator, no chance to actually have a conflict in your neat portraits folder
- ugly, dark UI. For those of you who cannot stand the light

## Limbo
- add input fields to edit the default sizes
- add input field to add a custom name
